- Refactored existing codebase based on `Flask` into a modular structure with clear, well-enforced domain boundaries and a coherent public interface.
- Participated in designing and building a system of a service-oriented architecture.
- Worked to ship code for backend and dive deep into the database layer to handle complex querying needs leveraging `SQLAlchemy`.
- Successfully removed bugs and improved performance, resulting in a 50% increase in efficiency compared to the previous version.
- Built a high-performance application capable of handling heavy traffic by customizing Nginx and uWSGI for efficient request handling and response times.
- Developed a robust database layer using `PyMongo`, providing an effective abstraction layer and implementing system logging for better tracking and monitoring of data.
- Reduced human error and improved the development process by writing test cases using the `unittest` framework and following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology.
- Constructed system control `CLI` command lines using Cobra, enabling effective command-line interface (CLI) interaction and control of the application.
